      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I’m a motivated and adaptable individual with a strong work ethic and a passion for learning new skills. As a single mom, I’ve developed exceptional time management and multitasking abilities. I’ve had a variety of experiences, from stay-at-home mom, to screen printing professional, to customer service agent, which have equipped me with diverse skills and a unique perspective.

        Currently, I’m excited to be pursuing a career in the tech industry. I’m enrolled in a Tech-Moms class to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is to find a fulfilling role that allows me to support my two children while leveraging my growing technical skills.</p>
